Finance::Currency::Convert::XE
==============================

This module is a Perl extension for currency conversion available from
XE.com's Universal Currency Converter (tm) site.

This module was originally named WWW::UCC. However, upon discovering the
module Finance::Currency::Convert::Yahoo, I felt this module would fit better
under the F::C::C namespace.

INSTALLATION

I recommend you use 'ppm', 'cpanp' or 'cpan' as appropriate. However if you
wish to install this module by hand, then type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

make should be replaced with 'nmake', 'dmake' or other make as required.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules:

  WWW::Mechanize
  HTML::TokeParser

For testing this module requires:

  Test::More

For optional testing the module would like these other modules:

  Test::Pod
  Test::Pod::Coverage

SUPPORT

There are no known bugs at the time of this release. However, if you spot a
bug or are experiencing difficulties that are not explained within the POD
documentation, please submit a bug to the RT system (see link below). However,
it would help greatly if you are able to pinpoint problems or even supply a 
patch. 

Fixes are dependant upon their severity and my availablity. Should a fix not
be forthcoming, please feel free to (politely) remind me by sending an email
to barbie@cpan.org .
